This website was created as part of the curriculum for the CodeFirst:Girls Beginners coding course. CodeFirst:Girls aims to get more women into tech by offering them subsidised teaching at a range of locations across the United Kingdom.
Our course was hosted and delivered by the awesome developers at The Economist in Birmingham.
